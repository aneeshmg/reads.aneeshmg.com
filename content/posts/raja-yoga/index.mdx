Raja Yoga by Swami Vivekananda

> ** Introduction to a "type" of yoga (not yoga-asana, which has become synonymous with yoga these days) which focuses on the psychic (mind) abilities of the "self". Learn the methods, practises and processes that alleviate your mental/intellectual (and physical to a certain extent) abilities to superhuman levels, simultaneously realising there are more important goals to be pursued. **
