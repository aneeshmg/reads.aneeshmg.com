The Game by Neil Strauss

![the-game1.jpeg](the-game1.jpeg)

> ** The journey of a social "nobody" to becoming, arguably, one of the greatest pickup artists of the world, encompassing a despicable start, modest progressions, hitting the peak, spiralling out of control, facing the consequences, and more. Social engineering + understanding the individual's psyche from a dual (generic & evolutionary) perspective + brain hacks = Pickup artistry demystified. **
